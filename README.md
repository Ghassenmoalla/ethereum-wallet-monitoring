# Ethereum Wallet Monitoring

Welcome! If you've ever wanted a clear, real-time view of your Ethereum wallet's balance and its changes over time, you're in the right place. This project is all about giving you that insight, without the hassle.

Using Prometheus and Grafana, we've set up a way to not only track your Ethereum wallet balance but also visualize it in a way that's both meaningful and easy to understand. And the best part? It's all wrapped up in Docker containers, making setup and use as smooth as possible.

Whether you're testing out transactions on the Ethereum testnet or just curious about the ebb and flow of your wallet balance, our project aims to provide you with the tools you need to keep track, no fuss necessary.

So, dive in and see how we're making Ethereum wallet monitoring straightforward and accessible for everyone.
